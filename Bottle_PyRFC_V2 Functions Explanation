#Here's a explanation of what each function does in Bottle_PyRFC_V2:

#login_form() - This function displays a login form to connect to an SAP system. It shows an HTML page with fields for the SAP user, 
#password, application server host, system number, and client.

#login_submit() - This function receives the login form data and attempts to connect to the SAP system using PyRFC. If the connection is successful, 
#it saves the PyRFC connection object in the global variable conn and redirects the user to the function selection page. If the connection fails, it 
#redirects the user to an error page.

#choose_function() - This function displays a page with a dropdown menu for the user to choose one of three functions. The options are Read Table, 
#Transaction 1: Display a Material Master Record, and Transaction 2: Creating a Sales Order.

#error() - This function displays an error message if the login credentials provided are invalid.

#choose_table() - This function displays a form to enter the name of an SAP table that the user wants to read.

#show_table() - This function reads the data from the SAP table that the user entered and displays it in an HTML table. It uses the PyRFC 
#function RFC_READ_TABLE to get the table data and the Bottle function template() to render an HTML page with the table data.

#download_txt(): This function downloads a text file based on user input.

#define_material(): This function defines a material in SAP based on user input.

#display_material(): This function displays information about a material in SAP based on user input.
